In a previous life, I studied how the U.S. Congress made laws.  It may sound boring, but it was so exciting that I quit and very rarely talk to strangers about politics anymore.

That said, one of the nice things about studying the American federal legislature is that it has existed in a current form for a few hundred years. It is true that the United States has become a two party system (and we were destined for that at the start), but we've learned a lot about how ideology in Congress works.

There are TONS of books about it, and I have some opinions myself. However, this graph might give you a pretty quick rundown of how congressional ideology has evolved since the second world war.
